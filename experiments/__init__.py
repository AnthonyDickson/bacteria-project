"""This package provides two experiment suites: sklearn and cnn.

The sklearn suite runs a series of classification tests on the bacteria
fluorescence spectra data using several classifiers from scikit-learn.

The cnn suite is similar to the sklearn suite, but it also adds a convolutional
neural network.
